    <h1>Kenyan soft chapati</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <pre>
        3 Cups all purpose flour sieved(Not measuring cups)
        2 Tablespoon Margarine(Optional)
        1 Tablespoon Sugar(Optional)
        1/2 Teaspoon salt
        1 1/2 Cups warm water
        Oil for cooking
    </pre>
    <h2>Cooking instructions</h2>
    <pre>
        1.In a bowl, mix flour, sugar and salt. 
        Add Margarine, mix with hands to form crumbs. 
        I use a little bit of sugar in mine because I 
        love the savoury taste. Omit it, if you don't like sugar.
        2.Make a well and pour water bit by bit as
         you knead. Knead for atleast 5 mins, if the dough is sticky,
         add flour bit by bit as you knead.
        3.Continue kneading on your work surface for another 3 mins.
         (FOR SOFT CHAPATIS, YOU SHOULD KNEAD THOROUGHLY)
        4.Finally dough should be firm but soft and not sticky.
         Cover with a damp cloth/ cling film/plastic polythene bag for 30 minutes.
        5.After 30mins, knead again and cut into balls.
        6.Roll out the balls in a circular shape with a rolling pin, one at a time 
        and brush with oil.
        7.Fold and Cover them to keep them soft.
        8.Roll the balls out again forming the circle.(Layers should be 
        visible on the rolled out dough).
        9.In a medium heat, place your skillet, let it warm up. Then put your chapati ontop. 
        Fry both sides until brown. Once cooked remove and place it in a containee and cover
