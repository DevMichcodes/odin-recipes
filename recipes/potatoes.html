    <h1>Fried Potatoes with onions</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <pre>
        potatoes
        onions
        oil
        garlic powder
        salt 
        black pepper
    </pre>
    <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <pre>
        1. Heat the oil in a large frying pan, cast-iron skillet, or nonstick skillet over medium heat. 
        Once the oil is hot, stir in the sliced potatoes and sliced onions and sprinkle with garlic powder, 
        salt, and black pepper. Mix well to coat in the seasoning.

        2. Let the potatoes cook for 5 minutes without disturbing. The “first sear” is the most importan
        t so leave them to cook for 5-7 minutes before flipping.

        3. Continue to cook for approximately 20 minutes, flipping the potatoes every 5 minutes. Avoid over-mixing 
        or flipping, as this will result in mushy potatoes.

        4. You will know your potatoes are done when they are pleasantly charred along the edges and soft on the inside.

        5. Season with additional salt and black pepper to taste, or garnish with fresh parsley, if desired
